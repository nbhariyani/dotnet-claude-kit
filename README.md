## The Problem

Claude Code is powerful, but out of the box it doesn't know **your** .NET conventions. It generates `DateTime.Now` instead of `TimeProvider`. It wraps EF Core in repository abstractions. It picks an architecture without asking about your domain. It reads entire source files when a Roslyn query would cost 10x fewer tokens.

**dotnet-claude-kit fixes all of that.**

## What This Is

A curated knowledge and action layer that sits between Claude Code and your .NET project. Drop a single `CLAUDE.md` into your repo and Claude instantly knows:

- Which architecture fits your project (VSA, Clean Architecture, DDD, Modular Monolith)
- How to write modern C# 14 with primary constructors, collection expressions, and records
- How to build minimal APIs with `TypedResults`, `MapGroup`, and proper OpenAPI metadata
- How to use EF Core without repository wrappers, with compiled queries and interceptors
- How to test with `WebApplicationFactory` + `Testcontainers` instead of in-memory fakes
- How to navigate your codebase via Roslyn semantic analysis instead of expensive file reads
- **How to scaffold complete features, run health checks, review PRs, and enforce conventions**

**No configuration. No setup wizards. Just copy one file and go.**

## What Makes This 10x

v0.4.0 adds an **action layer** on top of the knowledge layer — Claude doesn't just know the right patterns, it actively applies them:

| Capability | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Scaffolding** | One command → complete feature with endpoint, handler, validator, DTO, EF config, and tests. All 4 architectures supported. |
| **Interactive Setup** | Guided project initialization: architecture questionnaire → tech stack selection → customized CLAUDE.md generation. |
| **Health Check** | Automated codebase analysis using MCP tools: anti-pattern scan, diagnostics, dead code detection, test coverage → graded report card. |
| **PR Review** | Multi-dimensional code review: anti-patterns, diagnostics, API surface changes, blast radius, architecture compliance, test coverage. |
| **Convention Learning** | Detects project-specific patterns (naming, structure, modifiers) and enforces them in new code. Adapts to your codebase. |
| **Smart Tools** | 15 Roslyn-powered MCP tools including dependency graphs, circular dependency detection, dead code finder, and test coverage mapping. |
| **Active Hooks** | 6 hooks for automated quality: format on edit, anti-pattern checks on commit, test result analysis, structure validation. |

## Why dotnet-claude-kit?

| Metric | Without Kit | With Kit | Impact |
|--------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Architecture decisions** | Claude picks randomly | Asks questions, recommends with rationale | Correct architecture from day one |
| **Code quality** | Generic C#, legacy patterns | Modern C# 14 with idiomatic .NET 10 | Zero "fix this pattern" revision cycles |
| **Codebase navigation** | Reads entire files (500-2000+ tokens each) | Roslyn MCP queries (30-150 tokens each) | **~10x token savings** on exploration |
| **Anti-patterns generated** | `DateTime.Now`, repository-over-EF, `new HttpClient()` | `TimeProvider`, direct DbContext, `IHttpClientFactory` | Production-ready on first generation |
| **Testing approach** | In-memory fakes, mocked everything | `WebApplicationFactory` + `Testcontainers` | Tests that catch real bugs |
| **Production resilience** | No retry, no circuit breakers | Polly v8 pipelines with telemetry | Handles transient failures automatically |

**The result**: Less time reviewing and correcting Claude's output. More time shipping features.

## Installation

### Plugin Install (Recommended)

Install as a Claude Code plugin — all 47 skills, 10 agents, 16 commands, 9 rules, hooks, and MCP config activate globally:

```bash
# In your terminal — install the Roslyn MCP server
dotnet tool install -g CWM.RoslynNavigator
```

Then inside a Claude Code session:

```
# Add the marketplace and install the plugin
/plugin marketplace add codewithmukesh/dotnet-claude-kit
/plugin install dotnet-claude-kit
```

**For local development/testing** (loads directly from disk, no install needed):

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/dotnet-claude-kit
```

### Per-Project Setup

Navigate to your project directory (existing or empty) and run:

```bash
/dotnet-init
```

**Existing project?** It detects your solution, scans .csproj SDKs, reads your tech stack from config, asks architecture questions, and generates a customized `CLAUDE.md`.

**Greenfield project?** It asks what you're building, scaffolds the full solution structure (`dotnet new sln`, projects, `Directory.Build.props`, `src/` and `tests/` folders), then generates `CLAUDE.md`. Follow up with `/scaffold` to add your first feature.

No manual template copying needed.

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual Template Copy (Alternative)</strong></summary>

If you prefer manual setup, copy the template matching your project type:

```bash
cp templates/web-api/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md           # REST API
cp templates/modular-monolith/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md   # Multi-module system
cp templates/blazor-app/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md          # Blazor app
cp templates/worker-service/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md      # Background workers
cp templates/class-library/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md       # NuGet packages
```

Replace `[ProjectName]`, update tech stack, choose your architecture.

</details>

Start Claude Code — 47 skills, 10 agents, 16 commands, 9 rules, and 15 MCP tools activate automatically.

That's it. Claude now writes .NET code the way a senior .NET engineer would.

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual Install (Alternative)</strong></summary>

If you prefer to clone the repo and wire things up manually:

```bash
# 1. Install the MCP server globally
dotnet tool install -g CWM.RoslynNavigator

# 2. Register it in Claude Code at user scope (available in ALL projects)
claude mcp add --scope user cwm-roslyn-navigator -- cwm-roslyn-navigator --solution ${workspaceFolder}

# 3. Clone the kit
git clone https://github.com/codewithmukesh/dotnet-claude-kit.git

# 4. Load as a local plugin (or copy a template manually)
claude --plugin-dir ./dotnet-claude-kit
```

</details>

## What You Get

### Before dotnet-claude-kit

```csharp
// Claude generates this
public class OrderService
{
    private readonly IOrderRepository _repo;  // unnecessary abstraction over EF Core

    public async Task<Order> CreateOrder(CreateOrderDto dto)
    {
        var order = new Order();
        order.CreatedAt = DateTime.Now;  // wrong — use TimeProvider
        order.Items = dto.Items.ToList();
        await _repo.AddAsync(order);
        return order;  // leaks domain entity to API
    }
}
```

### After dotnet-claude-kit

```csharp
// Claude generates this
public static class CreateOrder
{
    public record Command(string CustomerId, List<OrderItemDto> Items) : IRequest<Result<Response>>;
    public record Response(Guid Id, decimal Total, DateTimeOffset CreatedAt);

    internal sealed class Handler(AppDbContext db, TimeProvider clock)
        : IRequestHandler<Command, Result<Response>>
    {
        public async Task<Result<Response>> Handle(Command request, CancellationToken ct)
        {
            var order = Order.Create(request.CustomerId, request.Items, clock.GetUtcNow());
            db.Orders.Add(order);
            await db.SaveChangesAsync(ct);
            return Result.Success(new Response(order.Id, order.Total, order.CreatedAt));
        }
    }
}
```

**TimeProvider injection. DbContext directly. Result pattern. Response DTO. Sealed handler. CancellationToken propagation.** Every pattern Claude uses comes from the skills in this kit.

## Agents (10)

Specialist agents that Claude routes queries to automatically. Each agent loads the right skills, uses MCP tools for context, and knows its boundaries.

| Agent | When It Activates | What It Does |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| [dotnet-architect](agents/dotnet-architect.md) | "set up project", "architecture", "scaffold feature", "init project" | Runs the architecture questionnaire, scaffolds features, initializes projects |
| [api-designer](agents/api-designer.md) | "create endpoint", "OpenAPI", "versioning" | Designs minimal API endpoints with proper metadata, versioning, and auth |

| [code-reviewer](agents/code-reviewer.md) | "review this code", "PR review", "health check", "conventions" | MCP-driven multi-dimensional review, convention detection and enforcement |
| [build-error-resolver](agents/build-error-resolver.md) | "fix build", "build errors", "won't compile" | Autonomous build-fix loop: parse errors → categorize → fix → rebuild |
| [refactor-cleaner](agents/refactor-cleaner.md) | "clean up", "dead code", "de-sloppify" | Systematic cleanup: dead code removal, formatting, sealing, CancellationToken |

## Templates (5)

Drop-in `CLAUDE.md` files that configure Claude for specific project types. Copy one file, replace the placeholders, done.

| Template | For | Includes |
|----------|-----|----------|
| [web-api](templates/web-api/) | REST APIs, microservices | Architecture options (VSA/CA/DDD), minimal APIs, EF Core, testing |
| [modular-monolith](templates/modular-monolith/) | Multi-module systems | Module boundaries, per-module DbContext, MassTransit integration events |
| [blazor-app](templates/blazor-app/) | Blazor Server / WASM / Auto | Component organization, render mode strategy, bUnit testing |
| [worker-service](templates/worker-service/) | Background processing | BackgroundService patterns, MassTransit consumers, proper cancellation |
| [class-library](templates/class-library/) | NuGet packages, shared libraries | Public API design, XML docs, semantic versioning, SourceLink |

## Roslyn MCP Server

Token-efficient codebase navigation via Roslyn semantic analysis. Instead of Claude reading entire source files (500-2000+ tokens each), it queries the MCP server for exactly what it needs (30-150 tokens).

| Tool | What It Does | Replaces |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `find_symbol` | Locate type/method definitions | Grep/Glob across all .cs files |
| `find_references` | Find all usages of a symbol | Grep for the type name |
| `find_implementations` | Find interface implementors | Searching for `: IInterface` |
| `find_callers` | Find all methods calling a method | Manual grep for method name |
| `find_overrides` | Find overrides of virtual/abstract methods | Searching for `override` keyword |
| `get_type_hierarchy` | Inheritance chain + interfaces | Reading multiple files |
| `get_project_graph` | Solution dependency tree | Parsing .csproj files manually |
| `get_public_api` | Public API without full file | Reading entire source files |
| `get_symbol_detail` | Full signature, params, XML docs | Reading entire source files |
| `get_diagnostics` | Compiler warnings/errors | Running `dotnet build` and parsing |
| `detect_antipatterns` | 10 .NET anti-pattern rules | Manual code review |
| `find_dead_code` | Unused types, methods, properties | Manual inspection of all files |
| `detect_circular_dependencies` | Project and type-level cycles | Manually tracing references |
| `get_dependency_graph` | Method call chain visualization | Reading multiple files and tracing |
| `get_test_coverage_map` | Heuristic test coverage mapping | Searching for test files manually |

The MCP server starts automatically via `.mcp.json`. No manual setup required.

See [mcp/CWM.RoslynNavigator/README.md](mcp/CWM.RoslynNavigator/README.md) for details.

## Knowledge Base

Living reference documents updated per .NET release:

| Document | Purpose |

| [breaking-changes](knowledge/breaking-changes.md) | .NET migration gotchas |
| [decisions/](knowledge/decisions/) | Architecture Decision Records explaining every default |

## Hooks (7)

Automated workflow integration:

| Hook | Event | What It Does |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `pre-bash-guard.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Blocks destructive git ops (force push, reset --hard), warns on risky commands |
| `pre-commit-format.sh` | Pre-commit | `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` ensures consistent formatting |
| `pre-commit-antipattern.sh` | Pre-commit | Detects DateTime.Now, async void, new HttpClient() in staged files |

| `post-edit-format.sh` | Post-file-edit (*.cs) | Auto-formats C# files after edits |
| `post-test-analyze.sh` | Post-test | Parses test results and outputs actionable summary |
| `pre-build-validate.sh` | Pre-build | Validates project structure (solution file, Directory.Build.props, test projects) |

## Defaults & Decisions

Every default is documented with an ADR explaining **why**:

| Decision | Default | Why |
|----------|---------|-----|
| Architecture | Advisor-driven | Asks questions first, then recommends VSA, CA, DDD, or Modular Monolith ([ADR-005](knowledge/decisions/005-multi-architecture.md)) |
| Error handling | Result pattern | Exceptions are for exceptional cases ([ADR-002](knowledge/decisions/002-result-over-exceptions.md)) |
| ORM | EF Core | Best developer experience for most scenarios ([ADR-003](knowledge/decisions/003-ef-core-default-orm.md)) |
| Caching | HybridCache | Built-in stampede protection, L1+L2 ([ADR-004](knowledge/decisions/004-hybrid-cache-default.md)) |
| APIs | Minimal APIs | Lighter, composable, architecture-agnostic |
| Testing | Integration-first | `WebApplicationFactory` + `Testcontainers` over in-memory fakes |
| Time | `TimeProvider` | Testable, injectable, no more `DateTime.Now` |
| HTTP clients | `IHttpClientFactory` | No more `new HttpClient()` socket exhaustion |
